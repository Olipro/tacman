features & bugs
---------------

* is there a more efficient way to check outbox_locked? on add_to_outbox
* need a way to clear system message if it is missing verb or content
  this becomes a problem if system log is is invalid. keeps trying to send, and keeps making
  more system logs.
* backgroundrb seems to be constantly thrashing the db reading job queue status or something gay

* need a way to periodically restart backgroundrb. maybe a cron job for user 'apache'

* test changes to outbox_manager_worker and writing to outbox

* verify all workers

* test publishing

* test account lockout

* import old logs into new system

* script to port users to new system
User.find(:all).each {|u| puts "#{u.username}, #{u.hashed_password}, #{u.hashed_enable}, #{u.salt}, #{u.first_name} #{u.last_name}, #{u.email},, #{u.department}\n"}

* script to import nogs, acls, etc...
